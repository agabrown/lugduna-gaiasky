This folder holds the animation frames generated with GaiaSky.

* The frames are not stored on github.
* The two special frames `startframe.png` and `endframe.png` are stored on github. These have to be extracted from the set of
  animation frames, where the start frame is one of the frames with the solar system view from the top, while the end frame
  is the last frame generated for the animation.
