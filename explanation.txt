We follow the asteroid 1133 Lugduna, named after Leiden, in its orbit
around the sun during the ‘Leiden European City of Science’ year 2022.

The animation starts with a view of the solar system up to the orbits
of Jupiter and Saturn. We then zoom in on the inner solar system where
we find Lugduna on its orbit around the sun. We follow the orbital
motion of Lugduna and the planets during the year 2022. You can see
how the earth ‘overtakes’ Lugduna over the course of a year.

Orbital elements of Lugduna:
Period 3.2 year, semimajor axis 2.2 au, eccentricity 0.2, inclination 5.4°
